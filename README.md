# Conjoint-Analysis-on-Job-preferences
ðŸ“Š MBA Conjoint Analysis on Job Preferences (MNL Model)

This project uses Multinomial Logit (MNL) Regression to analyze how MBA students in India make trade-offs when choosing between job offers with varying attributes.
ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To identify which job-related attributes most influence MBA students' preferences and decision-making using choice-based conjoint analysis.
ðŸ§ª Methodology

    Choice Tasks: Each respondent answered 10 pairwise job choice tasks.

    Data Collection: Responses collected via a Google Form.

    Model Used: Multinomial Logit (MNL) using statsmodels.

    Encoding: One-hot encoding with user-specified base levels (e.g., 12 LPA as base salary).

    Analysis:

        Estimation of attribute-level coefficients.

        Utility-based attribute importance scores.

        Visualizations using heatmaps and bar plots.

ðŸ“‚ Project Contents

    conjoint_transformed_sample_csv.csv: The transformed dataset used for analysis.

    conjoint_analysis.ipynb / main script: End-to-end implementation of the MNL model, encoding, and visualization.

    Heatmaps and charts of model outputs.

    Supplementary data from demographic questionnaire (e.g., work experience, relocation preference).

ðŸ“ˆ Sample Insights

    Job Security and Work-Life Balance emerged as the most influential attributes.

    Surprisingly, Salary was less important than expected for some respondents.

    The analysis helped uncover trade-offs individuals make between money, security, and lifestyle.

ðŸ§® Techniques Covered

    Multinomial Logit regression (statsmodels.MNLogit)

    One-hot encoding with custom category ordering (sklearn.OneHotEncoder)

    Utility range-based attribute importance

    Hypothesis testing (t-tests) on demographic variables (via Excel)
